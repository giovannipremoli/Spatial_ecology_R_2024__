# the presentation is on the professor's account -> in situ data collection, multivariate analysis, dimensionality -> 04 
# hyper-niche o nicchia -> environment with the best condition for a specie 
# our brain can only see 3 dimensions, so a fourth plot is not addable. We need to compact the datas. For instance, let's reduce 3 dimensions to 2 dimensions
# for doing that we have to imagine to solve a cube into a foldable paper 
# let's imagine an hypercube, an immaginary cube that solves himself in 4 dimensions, and aplly this cube in the solved cube in 2 dimensions -> there's a paint with jesus on an hypercube cross
# let's draw 2 axis with some points that are on the bisettrice or nearby that. The points information are 50% given by the axis 1 and 50% by the axis 2. If we draw the bisettrice that's our Component 1 and his axis will be Component 2. In this situation 90% of the information are given by Component1 and only 10% are given by Component2. That's an example fo PCA -> Principal Component Analysis, and in this case the principal is Component1
# N.B. it's not a bisettrice, but the compact data rappresentation. It will not always be that straight and precise
